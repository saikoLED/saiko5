With gratitude to R.J. Ryan and Perry Hung, who wrote so many patches to the wishield firmware to get it to work that it boggles the mind. And to RJ for his sweet patch to his own software Mixxx to make it control the lights using open sound control. For posterity:

A special thanks to Dimitri Turbiner for his contribution of ideas and example PD patches back in 2011.
